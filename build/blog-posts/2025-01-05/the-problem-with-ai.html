                <h1>The problem with AI</h1>
                <p>Over the past few years, we've seen an explosive trend in the use of AI tools, such as ChatGPT,
                    Midjourney, Dall-E 2, Sora AI, and so many other AI models, that it's hard to even count them all.
                    What may you ask is the problem with all these AI models? It is too accessible, too good at what it
                    does, and it devalues human work. From art commissions, to graphic design... AI can fill the shoes
                    of nearly everybody in the job market today who works normal office jobs. Even though AI may not do
                    many things perfectly, it still does enough to cause a massive disruption in the job market
                    world-wide. So what can we do about all this? All we can do is sit back, and watch, because this is
                    the next best thing since the birth of the internet. It will only improve more and more, and that's
                    a scary thought. We will have to choose career paths based on when, if at all, it will be replaced
                    by AI. Blue collar jobs are slowly making a comeback, as robotics still has lightyears ahead to go
                    before it can do everything a human can do. Why are blue collar jobs safe for the time being?
                    Something as simple as washing, packing, and drying dishes, requires a lot of knowledge of physics.
                    It requires the ability to handle objects in a fluid, natural way, which often requires a lot of
                    clever manouvering of fingers, arms, etc. This processing power the human mind has, is still far
                    better than any robot of today. Humans are just so hyper-aware of their surroundings, how objects
                    behave, how mass vs. object texture comes together to form decisions, such as, "Can I manage to
                    carry these three objects without them being at risk of falling?" When you really sit and think
                    about it... This is just dishes we're talking about. What about cooking? Cooking for people at a
                    restaurant? Now, AI doesn't seem like such a threat anymore, because these robots need
                    specially-designed spaces to do their tasks. They are rigid, and limited in what they can do. We are
                    entering a true cyberpunk dystopia, and it's not gonna look as pretty as the music, movie, and
                    visual art genre. My prediction is that the world is gonna be owned by a handful of
                    megacorporations. There will be poor wastelands stretching over most of the populated area on Earth,
                    and we'll have a few super rich cities dotted around, exploiting the poor masses to keep up their
                    infrastructure. The only food that the poor can afford, are blocks or packets of bug gel, sold by
                    one of the megacorporations. The super rich get to afford real meat, vegetables, fruits, grains,
                    etc., which are farmed within the safe confines of these walled cities. But that's just my
                    prediction. This may not ever happen. I do not have a problem with AI itself. The problem I have, is
                    that people are trying to shoehorn AI into a capitalistic world. If we weren't living in a system,
                    where we should work to earn a piece of paper called "money", then I wouldn't have a problem with
                    AI. If there was a system where we could do what we wanted, whenever we wanted, then AI is more than
                    welcome, because it actually improves our quality of life even more, because it's not threatening
                    our existence.</p>
