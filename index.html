            <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm <b>Warren Van Zuydam</b>. I created this personal website, mainly to show off my random skills,
                host my
                portfolio, blog posts, etc. This website is for anyone looking to either employ me full-time, or hire me
                for my freelance services. I'm a self-taught web developer, graphic designer, and a freelance general
                transcriptionist with over 3
                years of experience. This website is built by me, using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though I can
                make super-modern-looking websites, with fancy nav menus, animations, etc., I decided to keep this
                website simple for maintenance sake. I enjoy making websites as a hobby, but I plan to do this as a
                service as well some time.
                If you haven't noticed, I am a "DIY"
                type of guy, and a bit of a computer nerd, so I will do anything and everything I take interest in, as
                long as it involves a computer. If you are part of a hiring team, then
                take a look at my portfolio, or <a href="mailto:warrenvanz@gmail.com">email</a> me to request my CV.
                This website is my digital home, so <i>not everything</i> should be taken
                seriously here, okay? There is a lot of serious stuff I host here, such as my freelance services, but
                there are
                also blog posts on random topics, art, etc.
