                <h1>Why Adobe is absolute rubbish
                    for aspiring designers</h1>
                <p>W-what? You said it's industry standard? You know what else is industry standard? The lack
                    of
                    fucks I give!</p>
                <h2>The
                    costs of Adobe products create a paradox in space and time</h2>
                <p>You know what I fucking hate? Paradoxes. Imagine you're a "qualified" graphic designer...
                    alright? And here you are, this stupid
                    motherfucker,
                    who thought paying a fortune for a graphic design course would get you a job. I digress...
                    Imagine you are thousands in debt, with a parasite called "Adobe Creative Cloud" syphoning
                    your bank account dry every month, whilst you desperately apply for jobs which require
                    decent experience in said software. What does that make you feel? I bet you'd probably feel
                    "Ohhh,
                    shit! I'd better find a job quickly, before I decide to pull the plug on my Adobe
                    subscription, and possibly become rusty as fuck at my work!" Hey, we all love a job, right?
                    Don't we
                    all like to make some honest money? Yeah, well... Apparently Adobe has other plans, one of
                    which is labelling itself as the "industry standard design software", and another is sipping
                    off your broke-ass bank account. The time is ticking... Your parents are getting mad at you
                    for not finding a job... You are starting to develop an unhealthy obsession with anime...
                    Adobe is having an all-you-can-eat buffet... What the fuck do you do? I dunno, figure it
                    out, lol.</p>
                <h2>Adobe
                    likes to
                    throw a "fuck you termination fee"</h2>
                <p>You know what fucking I hate? Termination fees. I don't know what kind of sick, deranged
                    person gets a boner from having to PAY to stop using a subscription service. Adobe is the
                    ONLY sick piece of shit that demands a last slice from your bank account before you
                    ultimately piss off, and never come back again. Don't believe me? <a
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/wflha9/wow_cancellation_fee_for_early_termination/"
                        target="_blank">Get a load of this horse shit</a>.</p>
                <h2>Desperate moves turns into regret</h2>
                <p>You know what I fucking hate? Malware. Some of you smartasses might've thought, "Hey, I'll
                    just pirate this shit, ahahah!"... only to then download that sweet, sweet cracked .exe, run
                    it, and... Ohhh shit, my fucking accounts are being hacked! Ohhh shit, where is my money?!
                    And your Adobe subscription is like, "Hey, where the fuck did my money go?" Now you're both
                    sitting there, wondering where your money went. Info stealer malware has claimed yet another
                    desparate victim. Your problem is no longer the fact that you can't find work. Now, you are
                    rushing, trying to secure your online accounts. Your inbox is being overwhelmed with
                    "suspicious activity detected", and "your email and password has been changed". You are not
                    only fucked, but you are double-butt-fucked!</p>
                <h2>Okay, so
                    wtf is the solution then?</h2>
                <p>You know what I fucking hate? Solutions. Just kidding. I'm kidding, c'mon! The solution...
                    is "Free and Open Source Software". Stop being a little bitch to these corporations (Trust
                    me, they have enough money), and use
                    a product made by the people, FOR the people! Drop this "Adobe is industry standard" shit.
                    No, it's not! You've been gaslit into thinking it's the only option for digital designers.
                    This entire fucking website I made, my operating system, the programs I use to code, do my
                    designs, etc. is FREE! I don't pay a fucking dime for anything. My bank account is only
                    getting bigger, because I don't pay for "subscription services", whatever the hell that
                    phrase means.</p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Fuck Adobe. That's my conclusion.</p>
