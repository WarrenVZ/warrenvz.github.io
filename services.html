                I will take your low-quality logo, web graphic, etc., and turn it into a
                crisp, infinitly-scalable image, known as an "SVG" (Scalable Vector Graphic), so you can own a proper
                source
                image for web use, stickers, billboards, etc.. This is done by professionally tracing nearly everything
                by hand to
                avoid artifacts such as wobbly lines, islands, etc. that come with auto tracing functions. Humans will
                always
                be needed for tracing low-quality graphics, as they're not an algorithm blindly following pixels on a
                screen. Only humans can understand exactly what look the original image graphic was going for. So if
                this sounds good
                to you, then...

            <h1>FAQs</h1>

            <h2>Do you support CMYK?</h2>
            <p>Yes, I provide both an RGB, as well as a CMYK version of your vector graphic.</p>

            <h2>How much does a basic vector trace cost?</h2>
            <p>All projects start from R150, however, this changes based on several factors, such as number of colors,
                image complexity, image quality, number of revisions, etc.</p>

            <h2>Which file formats do you provide?</h2>
            <p>I will export your work in .SVG, .EPS, .PDF, .PNG (high-quality), and .WEBP (high-quality).</p>

            <h2>What's your preferred payment method?</h2>
            <p>At the moment, I only support EFT. PayPal support is coming very soon.</p>

            <h2>What if I'm not happy with the initial results?</h2>
            <p>I offer one free revision for your project. All revisions beyond that will
                be a flat fee of R50 each. With every revision, I request a detailed list of changes you want me to
                make. This way, you make the most out of each revision.</p>

            <h2>What about copyright?</h2>
            <p>When submitting artwork for vectorization, you confirm that you either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(a) own the copyright, trademark, or associated rights to the design, or</li>
                <li>(b) have written authorization from the rights holder.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I do not recreate copyrighted or trademarked materials without proof of permission. The client is fully
                responsible for ensuring that submitted artwork does not infringe on third-party rights.</p>
